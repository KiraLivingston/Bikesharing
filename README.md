**Visual 2**

This image shows a line graph comparing genders and time of day that the bike sharing program is used and the trip duration for the user.  It appears that males are the dominant users and have a longer ride duration than female riders.

The bar graph is an easy way to solidify that commuting hours are the peak times for the ride share program.

**Visual 7**

These two tables compare the top starting and ending locations for riders.  It is noticeable that both the starting and ending locations are equally active areas.
